### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

I'm surprised at how cool Metabase is! It’s the most helpful for my current line of work.
Learning-wise, I need to channel a growth mindset. I’m showing up to learn from the best, even if my brain cells are fried and can barely keep up.

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
